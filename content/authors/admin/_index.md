I am interested in modeling interconnections between climate change and plant phenology with [Dr. Kai Zhu](https://zhulab.seas.umich.edu/). I graduated from the [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in 2022 with a BE degree in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering, where I worked on wind speed’s impact on wind power generation and sand-dust storms with [Dr. Zhenzhong Zeng](https://www.zhenzhongzeng.com/). In my spare time, I enjoy sports and nature observation.
